<div align="left"><p>I consider myself a hacker, in the <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/hacker">positive connotation</a> of the word, and an open source technologist. I've been using open source software, including operating systems like Linux and BSD, since early 1995. I know that there's always multiple ways to do things, which leads to constant learning and discovery to solve technical challenges. As I consider myself to be standing on the shoulders of giants, I pay it forward by sharing everything that I write as open source.</p>
