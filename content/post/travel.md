<div align="left"><p>I was very fortunate to be able to travel and work with people from all over the world when I worked in the biodiversity realm, along with some limited national travel for infosec conferences. The current list of countries I've traveled to: Mexico, Jamacia, United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Germany, China and France. I greatly look forward to adding to that list!</p>
