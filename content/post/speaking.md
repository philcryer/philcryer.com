<div align="left"><p>I've spoken to audiences around the world on topics of using open source software, archival techniques for scientific biodiversity data, and infomation security. I've spoken at infosec conferences such as DEF CON, Derbycon, B-SidesLV, SecureWorld and Semafor-ISSA. These talks focus on user's electronic rights and civil liberties while educating users about how their data is used by companies so they can to increase their privacy online. As an active member of the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) I lead online discussions on ongoing legal issues and assist in working with other grassroots groups to share knowledge.</p>
