I have been very fortunate to travel and work with some amazing people from all over the world collaborating in the biodiversity realm, and speaking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">infosec</a> conferences. The current list of countries I've traveled to: Mexico, Jamaica, United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Germany, China, France, and Poland. I really love meeting new people and understanding new perspectives, so I really look forward to adding to that list of countries.
