I consider myself a hacker, in the <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/hacker">positive connotation</a> of the word, and an open source technologist. I've been using open source software, including operating systems like Linux and BSD, since 1995. I know that there's always multiple ways to do things, which leads to constant learning and discovery to solve technical challenges. As my work builds on other's work, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, so I pay it forward by sharing everything that I write as open source.
