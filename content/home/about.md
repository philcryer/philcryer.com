My official spiel says that I'm an Open Source technical generalist of senior caliber and interests, with over fifteen years of industry experience, including cloud computing, virtualization, networking, storage, converged systems, research and development, security, operations and special projects. Privacy advocate, and international speaker with a strong social media presence that enables high visibility into cutting edge technologies as well as an industry wide renowned reputation.

Basically I'm an open source technologist and privacy advocate, with a passion for art and music. I hold a bachelor's degree in fine arts, and believe that imagination is more important than knowledge. Above all I am a *gently aging punk* and a *practicing trouble maker*.
