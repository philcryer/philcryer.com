      <h3>McIntosh C24</h3>
      <p>The first solid-state pre-amplifier by McIntosh, I've owned this for about 5 years, it's for sale because I have upgraded to a McIntosh C32. It's fully functional but suffers some noise when adjusting the volume, a known issue cleaned with some spray by any reptuable shop. (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fak3r/17085042809/in/album-72157652190374965/">link to photos of the actual item</a>)</p>

      <h3>McIntosh MA 6100</h3>
      <p>A 70 watt per channel integrated amplifier by McIntosh, I've owned this for about 6 years, it's been professioanlly serviced and cleaned up, it's for sale because I've moved to tube amplification with some Primaluna monoblocks.

      <h3>Vandersteen 1C</h3>
      <p>A pair of Vandersteen speakers, I've owned these for about 4 years, they're in nice shape, no tears in the fabric, some marks around the top wood, but no 'dents' or anything too obvious. Selling because I love speakers, and I currently have too many. (<a href="http://www.highfidelityreview.com/vandersteen-1c.html">link to one photo of these in use</a>, can post more detailed closeups if reqeusted)</p>
