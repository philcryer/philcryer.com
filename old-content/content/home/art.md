I've been painting off and on most of my life, but didn't find my voice until college. After some stops and starts, I'm recently focusing much more time on new pieces and developing new art concepts. I explore texture and contrast by constantly mixing disparate paints and materials on dense, wood panels. In future pieces I'm planning to utilize new materials, and technology, to explore new concepts.
